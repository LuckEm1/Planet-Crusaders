# Planet-Crusaders
    This is MY FIRST PROGRAMMING PROJECT, I coded Planet Crusaders in 2018. The code may be ugly, but I can assure you, not a single peace of it has been copied on the internet.

WARNING: 
    This code has a 99.99% chance of giving you a week-long headache if you try to read and/or understand it.


To play this game, a few Python libraries are necessary:

    PyGame
    TkInter
    Flask


GAMEPLAY / LORE:

    You are an astronaut stranded on the moon, your objective is to survive as many waves/rounds of alien drone attacks as possible. Each round, the difficulty increases, spawning more enemies. When a round starts, a certain amount of level 1 drones will spawn on the outskirts of the map. They explode on contact, taking as many lives as their level (Ex: a level 2 enemy will take two lives). If two drones of the same level touch, they will merge, thus gaining a level and speed. The drones go up to level 4.
